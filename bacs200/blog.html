  <h2>Social Implications</h2>
  <p>In our daily lives its easy to take for granted the modern convenciences we are provided. Many people around the world aren't as fortunate to have access to clean running water.
  Many, particularly in third world countries rely on natural water sources. If these water sources are polluted it can be very detrimental for these people. Water pollution can result in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>- Reduced fish populations, resulting in less fish to consume.</li>
    <li>- Water that is unsafe to drink, it can spread disease and toxins.</li>
    <li>- Deficiencies in vital nutrients normally within the water and food.</li>
    <li>- Reduced tourism and unusable beaches, which also means fewer jobs.</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>Economic Implications</h2>
    <p>Water pollution can be a major problem economically, especially for coastal areas which rely on water for trade.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>- Reduced tourism: tourists don't like visiting places they see as unclean, and for impoverished countries tourism can be a primary driver of economic success.</li>
      <li>- Fewer Jobs: if there are no fish to catch or a lack of tourism for example, there will be fewer options for those looking for work. This can be devastating for those in third world countries, as any chance to provide jobs can be immensely helpful.</li>
    </ul>
      <h2>Political Implications</h2>
    <p>Fixing pollution can be an expensive undertaking, and it requires significant effort to clean and maintain water sources. In third world countries this could not only be a problem in terms of funding, but many political leaders are indifferent on the issue. In many cases the responsibility falls to a number of non-profit organizations like "Water for Good" to provide services within these countries.</p>
